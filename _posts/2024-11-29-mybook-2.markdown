Hello, cybersecurity enthusiasts and white hackers!

![book](/assets/images/139/2024-11-29_20-22.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

Alhamdulillah, I finished writing this book and we still going treatment with my daughter Munira. It was quite difficult since writing books are always difficult even for me with my experience. In sha Allah everything will be fine. O Allah, Lord of the Worlds, give strength to my daughter.        

Why is the book called that? **MD** - means **M**alware **D**evelopment, The **MZ** signature is a signature used by the MS-DOS relocatable 16-bit EXE format and its still present in today's PE files for backwards compatibility., also **MD MZ** means **M**y **D**aughter **M**unira **Z**hassulankyzy.    

I will be very happy if this book helps at least one person to gain knowledge and learn the science of cybersecurity. The book is mostly practice oriented.

This book is dedicated to my wife, Laura, and my children, Yerzhan and Munira. I would like to express my deep gratitude to my friends and colleagues.     

Special thanks to Anna Tsyganova and Duman Sembayev.

The proceeds from the sale of this book will be used to treat Munira and charity funds from Kazakhstan:
