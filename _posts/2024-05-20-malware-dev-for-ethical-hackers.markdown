Hello, cybersecurity enthusiasts and white hackers!      

![book](/assets/images/121/2024-05-20_15-02.png){:class="img-responsive"}    

Alhamdulillah, I'm pleased to announce that my book [Malware Development For Ethical Hackers](https://packt.link/MalwareDevelopment) is available for pre-order on Amazon.     

I dedicate this book to my wife, Laura, my son, Yerzhan, and my little princess, Munira, and I thank them for their inspiration, support, and patience.    

I know that many of my readers have been waiting for this book for a long time, and many of us understand that perhaps I could not give comprehensive and exhaustive information on how to develop malware, but I am trying to my best for sharing my knowledge with community.

If you want to learn more about any area of science or technology, you will have to do your own research and work. There isn't a single book that will answer all of your questions about the things that interest you.     

I would be glad to receive feedback and am ready for dialogue. There will be many posts about the book in the near future as it is about to be published.     

I thank the entire team at Packt without whom this book would look different.     

I also want to thank all the employees of the [Butterfly Effect Company](https://www.bfe.team/) and [MSSP Research Lab](https://mssplab.github.io/).     

I will be very happy if this book helps at least one person to gain knowledge and learn the science of cybersecurity. The book is mostly practice oriented.
